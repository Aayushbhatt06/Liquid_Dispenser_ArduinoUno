# Liquid_Dispenser_ArduinoUno
Introducing our Liquid Dispenser, a precision device designed to select from three different containers and dispense a specific amount of liquid with microliter accuracy. This dispenser is ideal for the pharmaceutical industry, ensuring contamination-free liquid dispensing.

## How It Works
### 1. User Input: Through the Arduino IDE's serial monitor, the user is prompted to select the container number.
### 2. Container Selection: A servo motor positions the chosen container to receive the liquid.
### 3. Volume Input: The user is then prompted to enter the desired volume of liquid to be dispensed in milliliters.
### 4. Dispensing: The specified volume is accurately dispensed through the peristaltic pump, controlled by an Arduino Uno and a relay module.

## Components :-
### 1. Arduino Uno.
### 2. Peristaltic pump.
### 3. servo motor>
### 4. relay module.
### 5. 12v power supply.
### 6. other components like wires etc.

## Features
### 1. Peristaltic Pump: Ensures contamination-free dispensing by keeping the liquid inside the tube.
### 2. Accurate Measurement: Dispenses liquid with precision, essential for pharmaceutical applications.
### 3. User-Friendly: Simple input via the Arduino IDE's serial monitor for selecting containers and specifying volumes.

## Applications
Ideal for pharmaceutical industries where precision and contamination prevention are critical.
